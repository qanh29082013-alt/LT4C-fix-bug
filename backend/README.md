# LifeTech4Code API

This project exposes a production-ready FastAPI service that performs Google OAuth2 login (authorization code flow) with automatic user provisioning backed by PostgreSQL. It ships with a minimal HTML test client and Docker Compose deployment for one-command startup.

## Features
- Google OAuth2 login using the `openid`, `email` and `profile` scopes via `httpx`.
- Automatic user provisioning and field updates on repeated logins (email, username, display name, avatar URL).
- Signed HttpOnly cookie session powered by `itsdangerous`; Secure and SameSite=Lax toggled via environment.
- PostgreSQL persistence with SQLAlchemy 2.x and Alembic migrations executed automatically on app startup.
- `/me` endpoint exposing the authenticated profile and `/health` endpoint verifying API and DB connectivity.
- Lightweight Jinja2 page to exercise the flow (login button, profile preview, DB health badge, logout button).
- **Rewarded ads stack**: Monetag (client ticket flow) plus Google Ad Manager / IMA (SSV) with nonce issuance, Cloudflare Turnstile bot mitigation, Redis-backed idempotency, wallet ledgering, and Prometheus metrics. The `/earn` page only lazy-loads the SDK required for the selected provider.
- **Public asset drop**: Files placed in `root-be/` are served read-only via `/root-be/<path>` with extension allowlisting and traversal protection, ready for reverse-proxy rewrites to `dash.lt4c.io.vn/<file>`.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository and copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Populate `.env` with your Google application credentials and desired configuration values.
3. Ensure your Google application redirect URI is set to `${BASE_URL}/auth/google/callback` (see Google setup below).
4. Build and start the stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
5. Visit `http://localhost:8000` and use the **Login with Google** button. After consenting, the page will display your profile information as stored in the database.

The PostgreSQL container stores data in the `postgres_data` volume, so user records survive container restarts.

## Public static files

- Backend serves a dedicated read-only folder at `backend/root-be`. A `.gitkeep` file is tracked so the directory exists in source control; drop additional assets alongside it.
- Requests to `/root-be/<path>` resolve against that directory only. Any traversal attempts are blocked by real-path resolution and 404 responses.
- Permit list of extensions (`.txt`, `.json`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.ico`, `.css`, `.js`, `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.xml`) avoids accidentally publishing executable content. Update `ALLOWED_PUBLIC_EXTENSIONS` in `app/main.py` if you need to serve more types.
- Add a reverse proxy rule (e.g. in Nginx: `location / { try_files /root-be/$uri $uri @app; }`) to surface those files at `https://dash.lt4c.io.vn/<file>` without exposing the `/root-be/` prefix publicly.

## Rewarded Ads Flow

1. **Prepare (`POST /ads/prepare`)** ? The browser requests a session with placement, client hints, and Turnstile token. The backend enforces ASN/IP policy, cooldown, quotas, and issues either a Monetag ticket bundle or a GAM ad tag together with the hashed `deviceHash`. Monetag is returned by default unless the client explicitly selects Google.
2. **Monetag completion (`POST /ads/complete`)** ? The frontend loads the Monetag script, verifies the tab stays visible for `REQUIRED_DURATION`, then sends `{nonce, ticket, durationSec, deviceHash}`. The backend validates the HMAC ticket, acquires a Redis/in-memory nonce lock, checks quotas again, and credits the wallet.
3. **Google IMA SSV (`/ads/ssv`)** ? When the provider is `gma`, the page plays the returned ad tag via the Google IMA SDK. Google calls back with an SSV payload signed with HMAC/RS256; the backend validates signature, cooldown, quotas, and idempotency before rewarding.
4. **Wallet refresh** ? After a reward, the frontend refreshes `/wallet` and the authenticated profile. Every grant persists an `ad_rewards` record plus a matching wallet ledger entry.

### Anti-fraud measures
- Device fingerprint derived from UA, Client Hints, and IP subnet.
- Redis-backed nonce storage (`ads:nonce:*`) and event idempotency (`ads:event:*`).
- Adaptive cap reduces `DAILY_CAP_USER` when `SSV_FAIL_THRESHOLD` is breached in the last 30 minutes.
- Optional `X-Client-Signature` header (`HMAC(userId|clientNonce|timestamp|placement)`).
- `RateLimiter` now uses Redis for distributed throttling (`20 req / 2s` on `/ads/prepare`, `5 req / 10s` on `/ads/ssv`).
- Metrics exported at `/metrics`: success/error counters, reward totals, failure ratio, effective cap.

Grafana dashboards can scrape the Prometheus exposition directly. Example useful series:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `rewarded_ads_prepare_total{status="ok"}` | Successful `/ads/prepare` responses |
| `rewarded_ads_ssv_total{status="success"}` | Verified SSV callbacks |
| `rewarded_ads_reward_amount_total` | Total coins granted (labelled by `network` / `placement`) |
| `rewarded_ads_failure_ratio` | Rolling failure ratio used for adaptive cap |
| `rewarded_ads_effective_daily_cap` | Current dynamic per-user quota |

> **Note:** Google's OAuth API does **not** provide phone numbers. The `phone_number` field is always stored and returned as `null`, and the HTML test page labels it accordingly.

## Google Application Setup
1. Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create (or select) a project, then add an OAuth2 redirect under **APIs & Services → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** matching your `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` value.
3. In the OAuth consent screen, ensure the `openid`, `email` and `profile` scopes are added.
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into your `.env` file.

## Development
- Run `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` for local development (ensure Postgres is running and `.env` configured).
- Formatting and linting:
  ```bash
  black .
  ruff check .
  ```
- Type checking:
  ```bash
  mypy .
  ```

## Deployment Notes
- The Docker image is multi-stage, ensuring a slim runtime image with dependencies baked in.
- Alembic migrations run automatically on startup via the FastAPI `startup` event.
- The session cookie is HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, and optionally Secure. Toggle `COOKIE_SECURE=true` when serving over HTTPS.

## API Surface
- `GET /` – HTML test interface.
- `GET /health` – API/DB health payload.
- `GET /auth/google/login` – Starts the OAuth2 flow.
- `GET /auth/google/callback` – Handles the OAuth2 callback and issues the session cookie.
- `GET /me` – Returns the authenticated user profile (requires session cookie).
- `POST /logout` – Clears the session cookie.
## VPS Platform Extensions
- Coin-based VPS marketplace with admin-configurable products, worker registry, and session lifecycle management.
- SSE checklist streaming and worker callback security (HMAC + timestamp guard) replace raw log polling.
- Ads reward flow with nonce-based claims and provider adapters (Adsense, Monetag) guarded by feature flags.
- Support inbox with Kyaro AI assistant and human escalation paths; admin prompt editing and auditing included.
- Standalone worker service (`worker_service/`) that self-registers, receives jobs, and streams progress back to the core backend.

## Running the Worker Service
```bash
python -m worker_service  # listens on 0.0.0.0:8476
```
Provide the backend URL, admin token (plain), token id, and public worker base URL via `POST /register`. The worker signs all callbacks with the supplied token and reuses the core checklist template when reporting progress.
### Worker Deployment (Docker)

A standalone worker container is provided under `worker_service/`. Build and run it against an existing backend:

```bash
docker build -t vps-worker -f worker_service/Dockerfile .
docker run --rm -p 8476:8476 \
  -e WORKER_BACKEND_URL=https://api.example.com \
  -e WORKER_BASE_URL=https://worker-1.example.com:8476 \
  -e WORKER_ADMIN_TOKEN=plain-token-from-vault \
  -e WORKER_TOKEN_ID=token-uuid \
  -e WORKER_NAME=worker-1 \
  vps-worker
```

For local orchestration, `docker-compose.worker.yml` spins up backend + database + worker in one command.
